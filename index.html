Remove breast, and set aside. Add carrots. Simmer, partially covered, for 40 minutes. Remove remaining chicken; discard back and wings. Let cool slightly.

    <p>
      Combine the flour and pepper in a bowl, add the beef and toss to coat well. Heat 3 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot. Add the beef a few pieces at a time; do not overcrowd. Cook, turning the pieces until beef is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch; add more oil as needed between batches. Cover and cook, skimming broth from time to time, until the beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Add the onions and carrots and simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Add broth or water if the stew is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle among 4 bowls and serve.

    <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
    <p>
      Make your sushi rice on the stove top or using a rice cooker. Quinoa works excellent too! Season the rice with seasoned rice vinegar or a combination of plain rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Pour over your rice, fluff with a fork, taste, and adjust as desired. Remove rice from heat, fluff into a bowl and set aside. While the rice cooks/cools, prep your veggies! Slice into matchsticks and set aside. Once the rice is done you'll be ready to roll! To avoid messy clean-up and scrubbing, wrap your bamboo mat in plastic wrap. Lay a sheet of nori on top and grab your rice! Use a spoon to spread a thin layer of rice on the seaweed sheet. Place your toppings in the center, very close to one another and practically in a little veggie dogpile. For rice on the inside, line your veggies/seafood on top of the rice. For rice on the outside, flip the sheet of nori so the rice touches the plastic wrap and then add your vegetables to the seaweed-only side. Roll, squeeze, repeat: This one's hard to explain... but it's easy to do! The first roll will bind the ingredients into the center. Roll approx 1/4 of the mat and gently squeeze (so it sticks) and unfold the bamboo mat. Repeat the process until you've rolled the sheet of rice, seaweed, and veggies into a spiral. Give it one last squeeze to seal the deal. Slice into bite-sized discs with a freshly sharpened chef's knife. If you're topping your sushi with sashimi or avocado, first tightly wrap the roll in plastic wrap prior to slicing. This will keep everything neat and pretty an avoid the horrific act of flinging avocado slices all over the kitchen. Though if that sounds like fun to you, fling away! I'll stick with the saran wrap! Next pile on all your favorite toppings and set up a few sauces for dunking.
